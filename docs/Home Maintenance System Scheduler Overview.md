# Home Maintenance System Scheduler - Overview

Home maintenance system scheduler is an application you can use on your computer or mobile device to schedule periodic preventative maintenance for your home and vehicles. It allows you to specify the frequency of a maintenance item from daily to every four years. Once each week, you will be presented with a scheduling screen showing which maintenance is due that week, and a drag and drop interface to move them around. At the beginning of a month or quarter, you can schedule which weeks to perform the maintenance. You can even specify, in the maintenance card, any special scheduling requirements.

Individual maintenance tasks can be added to the system at any time, with as complete a description of the tasks as you wish.

The free version will be limited to a total of XX maintenance tasks. The paid version will be unlimited.

The system will integrate with Google calendar, and other calendar apps, and will send notifications to remind you of scheduled tasks. Overdue tasks will be visually distinctive (bold, red, flashing).
