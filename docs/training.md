# Java Design Patterns

Udemy course covering the Gang of Four Design Patterns with implementations in Java. This is a reasonably well done course, but it 
use some improvement. His treatment of the **Singleton** pattern doesn't cover all of the vairiations of that patter. His coverage of the **Visitor**
pattern goes off on an irrelevant tangent and does some work that overlapps with the Strategy Pattern.

# Domain Driven Design

Read the book by Eric Evans (2003 final draft version) Although there is a lot of overlap between DDD and other methodologies, and much of 
this book - or at least this prepublication version of the first draft - has been made obsolete by more recent releases of programming languages like java, the core concepts are strong. The _ubiquitous 
language_ concept strives to create a shared vocabulary between the product owner/users and the development team to define the 'model.' 
the concept of _model boundaries_ provides guidelines for both defining what can access which parts of a model, which  should be considered 
as application objects and which should be considered as value objects, where to make objects immutable or invariant, and so on. 
Application layering, and what to put inot each layer is covered indepth. Finally, Evans discusses at length how to keep the model pure in 
the face of competing models from different teams and political/management structures.

# Git and Git Hub Master Class 

Udemy course on using Git and Git Hub, by Eduardo Rosas of Learn Programming Academy. Great course for the most part. He spends some time 
Google's Collab Python integration that I found quite painfull, and he works mostly with Microsoft products (although he does switch back and 
forth between his Mac and Windows machines.) Good coverage of commandline uisng Git Bash on Windows, not so much using _Gitcmd._ Excellent 
coverage of branching and branching strategies. GitHub coverage includes creating new repositories, protecting repos against unwantted 
or premature merges. Cover's *MarkDown* in depth (hence this page!). I sitll have the git integrations with various IDE's left to complete
