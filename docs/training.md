# Java Design Patterns

Udemy course covering the Gang of Four Design Patterns with implementations in Java. This is a reasonably well done course, but it 
use some improvement. His treatment of the **Singleton** pattern doesn't cover all of the vairiations of that patter. His coverage of the **Visitor**
pattern goes off on an irrelevant tangent and does some work that overlapps with the Strategy Pattern.

## Domain Driven Design

Read the book by Eric Evans (2003 final draft version) Although there is a lot of overlap between DDD and other methodologies, and much of 
this book - or at least this prepublication version of the first draft - has been made obsolete by more recent releases of programming languages like java, the core concepts are strong. The _ubiquitous 
language_ concept strives to create a shared vocabulary between the product owner/users and the development team to define the 'model.' 
the concept of _model boundaries_ provides guidelines for both defining what can access which parts of a model, which  should be considered 
as application objects and which should be considered as value objects, where to make objects immutable or invariant, and so on. 
Application layering, and what to put inot each layer is covered indepth. Finally, Evans discusses at length how to keep the model pure in 
the face of competing models from different teams and political/management structures.

## Git and Git Hub Master Class 

Udemy course on using Git and Git Hub, by Eduardo Rosas of Learn Programming Academy. Great course for the most part. He spends some time 
Google's Collab Python integration that I found quite painfull, and he works mostly with Microsoft products (although he does switch back and 
forth between his Mac and Windows machines.) Good coverage of commandline uisng Git Bash on Windows, not so much using _Gitcmd._ Excellent 
coverage of branching and branching strategies. GitHub coverage includes creating new repositories, protecting repos against unwantted 
or premature merges. Cover's *MarkDown* in depth (hence this page!). I sitll have the git integrations with various IDE's left to complete.

## TDD with JUnit 5

Pluralsight course on JUnit 5 testing 

## Domain Driven Design: working with Legacy Projects

Pluralsight course on DDD, focusing on using Bounded Context and Anti Corruption layers to add functionality to existing "big ball of mud" applications. The concepts were fantastic, but, as I have found with all Pluralsight courses on DDD, the content was C#/dot-net focused. 

## Gradle Master Class
Udemy course on Gradle. Spent a lot of time of Groovy and scripting. A Decent course, but the Pluralsight course is better.

## Gradle Fundamentals
Pluralsight course on the Gradle build tool. Instruction was excellent enough that I was able to take what I learned and create a new project from scratch, including adding integration testing, code coverage metrics, deployment and publishing to Maven repositories, etc.

## Domain Driven Design Fundamentals

This Pluralsight course is far superior to the offering from Udemy, despite being C# focused. The two instructors walk through the process of defining requirements for a project for a veteranary clinic, including interactions with a "domain expert."

# College, Military and Non-Traditional Education

I do not have "A Batchelor's Degre in Computer Science." I am, however, able to document the equivalent of approximately 400 semester hours of formal post-secondary education, most of which would qualify as college level or higher. I will summarize thateducation below:

### Actual College

I have completed an General Education Associate of Science Degree at Salt Lake Community College based on courses taken there, at Western Governors' University, credit for military training that ACE recommends - and SLCC accepts - as equivalent to their regionally accredited curriculim, and other sources. I accepted the General Education degree because I had too many credits to continue receiving financial aid at SLCC, but fell shourt of the completed courses for an AS in Computer Science. As a "full time" student at SLCC for six semesters, I would have added a total of about 72 Semester Hours to what I already had. I would have to look at transcripts to determine what I did at WGU, etc. 

### Regional vs National Accredation

I have a "certificate" as a "computer programmer" from a school called "Certified Careers Institute." This school is nationally accredited, but lacks the regional accredation to be acceptable to SLCC or any other major college or school. CCI claims that the certificate program is equivalent to 60 semester hours. 

### Military Training

I am an alumni of the United States Navy's enlisted Nucler Power School, and attained the rank of Electronics Technician Chief Petter Officer, surface Warfare during 13 years of active duty. In order to get into Nucler Power School, I had to be in the top 10% of enlistees based on ASVAB test scores to apply, then pass the Nuclear Field Qualifying Test to be accepted. As an Electronics Technician (ET) I had to complete bootcamp, a basic electricity and electronics course, and a 6 month long ET-A school. 

Nuclear Power School is was a 26 week phase of 6-8 hours per day of classroom instruction, follwed by a 26 week practical phase. The curriculum was developed for the Navy by MIT. Unfortunately, most of the curriculim is classified by both the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, so it is not possible for ACE to evaluate it for college credit recommendations. Based on the general rule that the number of classroom contact hours per week is the equvalent of the number of semester hours, and based on a standard semester of 13-16 weeks, Nuclear Power School's classroom phase is the equivalent of somewhere between 60 and 80 Semester Hours. The practical phase requires students to study an actual nuclear plant prototype and qualify as an operator (in my case as a Reactor Operator) for 12 hours per day until the student has completed "checkouts" on all electrical, mechanical, chemical and nuclear systems; passed a comprehensive written exam, and passed an oral board. This is easily the equivalent of another 60-80 Semester Hours. (It should also be noted here that the nuclear field program lost 90% of its applicants before completion of the practical phase.)

In addition, there are training courses required for advancement, and advancement is based on completion of the courses and passing a written examination for each pay grade. ACE currently recommends a total of 124 Semester Hour credits for the combination of ET-A School, and the advancement courses through Chief Petty Officer.  

As a "re-enlistment incentive," the Navy also sent me to what they called "ETC& School" This was a 26 weeks school, with 6-8 hours per day of instrcution, in Electronics Technology, with curriculim developed by Community College of San Diego. Because there is overlap with other Navy training from advancement courses, etc. I am not figuring ETC7 into the total Semester Hour count.

That's a total of 284 Semester Hours Equivalents from military training, but it lacks the general education requirements and some of the courses are classified. 

How did I do as a student in these schools and courses? ET-A school - 3.9 GPA equivalent, graduated 3rd in my class of 90, the only student to qualify as "Order of the Ace;" In Nuclear Power School I was the first operator to qualify on the prototype I was assigned to, and 2nd to qualify in my class, graduated 8th of 256. Graduated from ETC7 School with a 3.9 GPA, 2nd in a class of 30; Rating exam for ET2 score 72/80, for ET1 80/80, for ETC 77/90. 

### Cumulative Credit

Adding the SLCC course work, the CCI certificate work, and the military training, that works out to a total of more than 412 Semester Hours. All of it successful. 

### Non-traditional, Non-Credit, and Autodidactive Education

I am an autodidact, a self-learner. I am a bibliophile, a lover of books. And I try to always have some sort of learning experience going on, whether it is reading or listening to audio books, researching information on the Internet, in a library or in my trusty old set of Encyclopedia Britanica, or watching/listening to lecture series from Great Courses and other sources. I am a firm believer in reading and understanding the classics. Here is a partial list of non-credit courses I have "consumed"from *The Great Courses* of *The Teaching Company:*
